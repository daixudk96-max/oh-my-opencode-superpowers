# Executing Plans

## Overview

Load plan, review critically, dispatch Implementer agent per task, with automatic checkpoints.

**Core principle:** Implementer agent per task + automatic checkpoints + error-triggered reviews.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the executing-plans skill to implement this plan."

## Phase Status

**State Transition**: `idle` → `executing`

This skill operates in the `executing` phase. The phase is automatically tracked via `.sisyphus/boulder.json`.

## The Process

### Step 0: Environment Check

⚠️ **REQUIRED: 开始前必须确认环境就绪**

1. **检查 Plan**
   - 确认 `tasks.md` 或 `docs/plans/` 中存在实施计划
   - 如无计划，引导用户先使用 `writing-plans` skill

2. **调用 using-git-worktrees skill**
   - **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:using-git-worktrees
   - 创建 worktree: `feature/{change-name}`
   - using-git-worktrees 处理：
     - 安全验证 (.gitignore 检查)
     - 依赖安装 (npm install 等)
     - Baseline 测试运行
   - 如已在 worktree 中工作，跳过此步骤

3. **恢复状态 (如有)**
   - 读取 `.sisyphus/boulder.json`
   - 如存在未完成任务，从上次中断位置恢复
   - 显示: "检测到未完成任务 {taskId}，将从此处继续"

### Step 1: Load and Review Plan

1. Read plan file
2. Review critically - identify any questions or concerns about the plan
3. If concerns: Raise them with your human partner before starting
4. If no concerns: Create TodoWrite and proceed

### Step 2: Execute Tasks via Appropriate Agent

**Executor Selection Logic (MANDATORY):**

Before dispatching each task, classify the task type and select the appropriate agent:

| Task Type | File Extensions / Keywords | Agent | Skills |
|-----------|---------------------------|-------|--------|
| **Documentation** | `.md`, `.rst`, `.txt`, `.adoc`, README, docs/, CHANGELOG | `document-writer` | [] |
| **Visual/UI** | `.tsx`, `.jsx`, `.vue`, `.css` with styling keywords | `frontend-ui-ux-engineer` | ["frontend-ui-ux"] |
| **Code** | `.ts`, `.js`, `.py`, etc. (logic, API, backend) | `category: "ultrabrain"` | [\"test-driven-development\", \"collaborating-with-codex\"] |

**Classification Decision Tree:**

```
Is task about documentation files (.md, .rst, docs/)?
  YES → document-writer
  NO  → Is task about visual/styling changes?
          YES → frontend-ui-ux-engineer
          NO  → category: "ultrabrain" (default)
```

**Pre-dispatch checklist (MANDATORY):**

- Use direct language in execution updates.
- Confirm what done means for the task in concrete terms before dispatch.
- Decide which files, tests, or outputs must be verified before the task can be reported as complete.

For each task, dispatch to the appropriate agent:

```typescript
delegate_task({
  category: "ultrabrain",
  description: `Implement Task ${taskId}: ${taskName}`,
  skills: [\"test-driven-development\", \"collaborating-with-codex\"],
  run_in_background: false,
  prompt: `
## ImplementerTaskContext

### 1. TASK
Task ID: ${taskId}
Name: ${taskName}
Risk Tier: ${riskTier}

### 2. TASK DESCRIPTION

${fullTaskText}

### 3. CONTEXT

${sceneSettingContext}

### 4. FILES
Create:
${filesToCreate}
Modify:
${filesToModify}
Test:
${testFiles}

### 5. ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
${acceptanceCriteria}

### 6. TDD NOTES (Tier 2/3 only)
${tddNotes}

### 7. MUST DO
- Follow existing code patterns
- Use Bun for tests
- Run lsp_diagnostics before completion
- Request Codex prototype before coding (Phase 2)
- Request Codex review after coding (Phase 3)
- Use direct language in execution updates.
- Define done in concrete terms before you report completion.
- Verify the relevant files, tests, or outputs before you say work is done.

### 8. MUST NOT DO
- Do not modify files outside the listed paths
- Do not skip TDD for Tier 2/3 tasks
- Do not suppress type errors
- Do not delegate to other agents

Work from: ${worktreePath}
`
})
```

### Step 2b: Handle Implementer Response

| Response | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `COMPLETED` | Record SHA, mark complete, continue to next task |
| `QUESTIONS` | Answer questions, resume Implementer with `resume=session_id` |
| `BLOCKED` | Stop, report to user, wait for feedback |

Accept `COMPLETED` only when the response says what changed, what was verified, and why the task now counts as done. If any of that is missing, continue the Implementer instead of marking the task complete.

### Step 2c: Auto Git Checkpoint

After each COMPLETED response:

1. Verify commit was made by Implementer
2. Record SHA in `.sisyphus/boulder.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "tasks": {
       "{taskId}": {
         "status": "complete",
         "sha": "abc123...",
         "completedAt": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Mark task as completed in TodoWrite
4. **自动继续下一个任务**（不等待人工确认）

**注意**: 仅在 BLOCKED 或错误时停止并等待反馈。

### Step 3: Report (仅在需要时)

**正常情况（无错误）：**
- 自动继续下一任务
- 无需等待人工反馈
- 用直接语言说明已完成内容、已验证内容、以及剩余工作

**遇到 BLOCKED 或错误时：**
- 显示已完成任务和 checkpoint SHAs
- 显示错误详情
- 停止并等待反馈：「遇到问题，需要反馈。」

**所有任务完成时：**
- 显示所有已完成任务汇总
- 显示所有 checkpoint SHAs
- 自动进入 Step 4（Complete Development）

### Step 4: Complete Development
 
After all tasks complete and verified:
- Announce: "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."
- **REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** Use superpowers:finishing-a-development-branch
- Follow that skill to verify tests, present options, execute choice

## Implementer Agent Workflow (Internal)

The Implementer agent follows this 5-step workflow internally:

```
Step 1: Understand Task → QUESTIONS if unclear
Step 2: Codex Phase 2 - Get prototype (read-only)
Step 3: TDD Implementation (Tier-based)
Step 4: Codex Phase 3 - Review
Step 5: Commit + Report (COMPLETED/BLOCKED)
```

The executor uses the `ultrabrain` category with IMPLEMENTER_DISCIPLINE_PROMPT.

## When to Stop and Ask for Help
 
**STOP executing immediately when:**
- Implementer returns BLOCKED
- Plan has critical gaps preventing starting
- You don't understand an instruction
- Multiple tasks fail consecutively
 
**Ask for clarification rather than guessing.**
 
## When to Revisit Earlier Steps
 
**Return to Review (Step 1) when:**
- Partner updates the plan based on your feedback
- Fundamental approach needs rethinking
 
**Don't force through blockers** - stop and ask.
 
## Remember
 
- Review plan critically first
- Dispatch Implementer agent per task (not manual implementation)
- Implementer handles Codex prototype + review internally
- Track commit SHAs from Implementer's COMPLETED reports
- Stop when BLOCKED, don't guess
 
## Manus Principles

### File Updates During Execution

During plan execution, maintain these files in `changes/{change-name}/`:

- **findings.md**: Update after research, discoveries, or browser operations
- **progress.md**: Update after completing each task/phase, log all errors

### 2-Action Rule

After every 2 view/browser operations, save findings to `findings.md`.
This prevents information loss in long context.

**Example:**
```
1. Read API docs → note in memory
2. Read implementation example → SAVE to findings.md
3. Read test patterns → note in memory  
4. Read error handling → SAVE to findings.md
```

### 3-Strike Protocol

After 3 consecutive failures on the same task:

1. **STOP** attempting further fixes
2. **Document** the failure in `progress.md` with:
   - What was attempted
   - What failed
   - Error messages
   - Potential root causes
3. **Move** to next task or ask for help

**Do NOT:** Try a 4th fix without human input or architectural review.

### Error Logging

Log ALL errors to `progress.md` immediately with:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Task ID | Which task failed |
| Attempt # | 1st, 2nd, or 3rd attempt |
| What was attempted | Specific action taken |
| What failed | Actual error or unexpected behavior |
| Error message | Full error text |
| Solutions tried | What was done to fix |

---

## Next Step

After all tasks are completed and verified:

| Condition | Next Skill | Action |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| All tasks complete | `verification-before-completion` | `skill("verification-before-completion")` to verify deliverables |
| Verification passed | `finishing-a-development-branch` | `skill("finishing-a-development-branch")` to complete the work |
| Branch finished | `archiving-changes` | `skill("archiving-changes")` or `/archive {change-name}` |

**REQUIRED:** Follow the complete workflow chain to ensure proper completion and archival.
